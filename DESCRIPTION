Title: Quantile Regression
Description: Estimation and inference methods for models of conditional quantiles: 
  Linear and nonlinear parametric and non-parametric (total variation penalized) models 
  for conditional quantiles of a univariate response and several methods for handling
  censored survival data.  Portfolio selection methods based on expected shortfall
  risk are also now included.
