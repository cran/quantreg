Title: Quantile Regression
Description: Estimation and inference methods for models for conditional quantile functions: 
  Linear and nonlinear parametric and non-parametric (total variation penalized) models 
  for conditional quantiles of a univariate response and several methods for handling
  censored survival data.  Portfolio selection methods based on expected shortfall
  risk are also now included. See Koenker, R. (2005) Quantile Regression, Cambridge U. Press,
  <doi:10.1017/CBO9780511754098> and Koenker, R. et al. (2017) Handbook of Quantile Regression, 
  CRC Press, <doi:10.1201/9781315120256>.
